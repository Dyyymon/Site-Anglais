            <h2>A City Designed for Women</h2>
            <p>In October 2022, Glasgow City Council adopted a feminist urban planning approach, making it the first city in the UK to integrate this vision.</p>
            <p>The initiative aims to create a safer, more inclusive, and accessible city by addressing the specific needs of women and marginalized groups.</p>

            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Many urban spaces have historically been designed with a male-centric perspective, neglecting the needs of women, caregivers, and marginalized communities.</p>
            <p>By redesigning cities with inclusivity in mind, we enhance safety, accessibility, and equality for all individuals.</p>
            <p>Glasgow’s approach is part of a broader global movement towards gender-sensitive urban planning, ensuring that cities serve everyone fairly.</p>
            <p>The policy also aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly gender equality and sustainable cities.</p>
